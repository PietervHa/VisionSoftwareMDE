"""
backend/detection/ocr/text_locator.py

Classical-CV dynamic text-region locator (OCRead mode only).

The printed dot-matrix text on the bottle cap ("3030 22:42" / "BB 02/25")
does not land in the same spot on every bottle, so a single static
cfg["roi"] box misses it whenever the cap is rotated/placed differently
under the camera. This module searches a (looser) region of the frame for
the printed text and returns its bounding box, so the OCR crop always
tracks the actual text instead of a fixed rectangle.

No trained model involved. Two stages:

1. Blackhat transform (cv2.MORPH_BLACKHAT) instead of a flat brightness
   threshold. A flat "pixel below N is ink" threshold also picks up the
   cap's embossed/molded features (the diagonal reinforcement ribs, the
   recycling triangle, "PE/PA") because those catch shadow under angled
   light and can be nearly as dark as the actual ink. Blackhat only
   responds to features *smaller than its kernel* against a locally
   brighter surround, so it suppresses the broad, large-scale shading of
   the molded ribs while still picking out the small printed characters.
2. Connected components on the blackhat result, then proximity-based
   clustering (union-find): printed text is many small components sitting
   close together, so the cluster with the most components (not simply
   every surviving pixel unioned together) is taken as the text block.
   This is what keeps stray specks - antialiasing on a mold line edge, a
   dust fleck - from dragging the bounding box out to somewhere the text
   isn't.

Tunable entirely through cfg["ocr"]["dynamic_roi"] (see config/default.yaml).
Returns None when nothing plausible is found, so the caller can fall back
to the static ROI.

    Straighten and crop *frame* to the rotated rect returned by
    locate_text_region(), so the printed line comes out horizontal

    Fast path: if the rect is already axis-aligned to within
    ANGLE_SNAP_TOLERANCE_DEG (the common case on a line where bottles land
    close to upright, not rotated by a large angle every cycle), this skips
    rotation entirely and takes a direct pixel slice instead. warpAffine
    always resamples the image, even for a 1-degree rotation, which softens
    fine dot-matrix stroke edges for no real benefit when there's nothing
    meaningful to straighten - the fast path keeps those frames exactly as
    sharp as a plain static-ROI crop.

    For everything else: crop a generous axis-aligned margin around the
    rotated rect first (cheap), rotate only that small sub-image (not the
    full frame), then take the final tight crop out of the rotated
    sub-image. Rotating the whole frame for every read would work too but
    costs much more for no benefit, since we only ever want the pixels near
    the rect.

    Note on orientation: minAreaRect's angle is only defined up to 180
    degrees, so this can hand back text that reads correctly but is
    upside-down in the frame. That residual 0/180 ambiguity is exactly
    what PaddleOCR's use_angle_cls is for - it classifies coarse
    orientation, it isn't meant to correct arbitrary continuous rotation
    on its own. The two stages are complementary: this function handles
